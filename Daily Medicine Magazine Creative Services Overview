Thanks for the clarification! Here's a revised, on-brand version of the services doc—this time representing **Daily Medicine Magazine** as your creative zine and cultural mentorship engine:

## 🌞 Daily Medicine Magazine  
**Creative Services Overview**

*A psychedelic outreach press offering visual storytelling, mentorship, and media medicine for the soul.*

### 🎨 Cover Album Generation Service

At **Daily Medicine Magazine**, we believe every artist deserves a visual identity as bold as their sound. Our cover generation offering is both an artistic collaboration and a cultural statement.

**Includes:**
- ✨ Custom digital album art based on the artist’s story, mood, or influences  
- 🌀 Visual themes inspired by vintage psychedelia, outsider folk, Indigenous futurism, garage band collage, or magical realism  
- 📛 Title consultation & typography styling (to match your message with your music)  
- 📱 Social-ready versions & archival-quality files for vinyl, streaming, or print

Whether you're crafting your debut mixtape or reviving garage demos from a lost summer—*we’ll give it a face that sings before the first note hits.*

### 🌿 Mentorship Services

Daily Medicine is more than a magazine—it’s a grassroots mentorship sanctuary for creators and cultural healers.

**What We Offer:**
- 🎓 Guidance for young or emerging artists, zine makers, and audio storytellers
- 🛠️ Advice on DIY media: from album assembly to distro tactics and fair use awareness  
- 🔥 Encouragement for creators from marginalized, rural, or under-resourced communities  
- 🌎 Support for those telling their stories through Indigenous, ancestral, or intergenerational lenses  

Our mentorship is peer-based, low-barrier, and rooted in care—not contracts. We don’t need you to fit an algorithm. We want you to be *loudly you.*

---

**Note**: All services are offered in the spirit of collaboration and self-determination. Daily Medicine Magazine doesn’t operate like a typical media agency. We’re a cultural greenhouse for forgotten futures—and your voice is the compost, rain, and wild sunlight.

Want this formatted into a print-ready flyer or featured on a services page inside your zine layout? I can help design the whole spread. 🎸🌈📖
